# IntroductionToRobotics
This repository contains a collection of hands-on robotics assignments undertaken during my third-year studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each assignment in this repository provides clear requirements, detailed implementation instructions, and includes the code and image files necessary.
