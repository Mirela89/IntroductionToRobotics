# Introduction To Robotics
This repository contains a collection of hands-on robotics assignments undertaken during my third-year studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each assignment in this repository provides clear requirements, detailed implementation instructions, and includes the code and image files necessary.
# RGB LED Control Using Potentiometers

The first assignment focuses on learning how to control the colors of an RGB LED light using potentiometers. Think of an RGB LED as a tiny, controllable traffic light, where you can make it show any color you want. Potentiometers are like knobs that let you adjust the amount of red, green, and blue light the LED gives off. By turning these knobs, you can create different colors, and even mix them to create unique ones.

Here's how it works:

* You have three potentiometers that you can twist. Each one represents a color channel: Red, Green, and Blue.
* When you turn the red potentiometer, it changes the intensity or brightness of the red light in the LED. Turning it more makes the red color stronger.
* Similarly, turning the green potentiometer changes the intensity of the green light, and turning the blue potentiometer changes the intensity of the blue light.
* By adjusting the three potentiometers together, you can create different colors. For example, if you turn up the red and green potentiometers while keeping the blue one low, you get a yellowish color. If you turn up only the blue potentiometer, you get a blue color.
  * [Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Y7U4Y1t5gCs) to see this functionality in action.
* The code in your Arduino takes the readings from the potentiometers and uses them to control the LED's colors, so it's like having a set of color knobs for your light. This way, you can experiment and create various colors by blending different amounts of red, green, and blue.

```cpp
/* This code is designed to independently manage the Red, Green, and Blue channels
of an RGB LED by utilizing separate potentiometers for each channel.*/

const int redPin = 11;   //red LED control pin
const int greenPin = 10; //green LED control pin
const int bluePin = 9;   //blue LED control pin

const int redInputPin = A0;    //analog pin for the red input (e.g., potentiometer)
const int greenInputPin = A1;  //analog pin for the green input (e.g., potentiometer)
const int blueInputPin = A2;   //analog pin for the blue input (e.g., potentiometer)

void setup() {
  pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  //read the values from the potentiometers
  int redValue = analogRead(redInputPin);
  int greenValue = analogRead(greenInputPin);
  int blueValue = analogRead(blueInputPin);

  //map the potentiometer values to the range 0-255 for PWM
  int redBrightness = map(redValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  int greenBrightness = map(greenValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  int blueBrightness = map(blueValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);

  //update the RGB LED with the new brightness values
  analogWrite(redPin, redBrightness);
  analogWrite(greenPin, greenBrightness);
  analogWrite(bluePin, blueBrightness);
}
```
